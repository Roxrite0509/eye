 (1)Choose sensor + test capture pipeline (RealSense SDK).
 (2)Implement lightweight detector on edge (tflite or ONNX).
 (3)Compute distances from depth map and attach to detections.
 (4)Format observations into the JSON schema.
 (5)Build phone WebSocket server to accept obs and route to LLM/TTS.
 (6)Implement LLM integration (cloud or local). Use system prompts above.
 (7)Implement TTS (Android/iOS) and haptics.
 (8)Add safety fallbacks and offline mode.
 (9)Field test with real users, iterate on phrasing and timing. Choose sensor + test capture pipeline (RealSense SDK).
